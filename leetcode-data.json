Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST. You may assume that next() calls will always be valid.

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article): • Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population. • Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. • Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population. • Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board . In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously . Given the current state of the board , update the board to reflect its next state. Note that you do not need to return anything.",

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes: • val : True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer. • isLeaf : True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children. class Node { public boolean val; public boolean isLeaf; public Node topLeft; public Node topRight; public Node bottomLeft; public Node bottomRight; } We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: • If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's ) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop. • If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo. • Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid. If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki . Quad-Tree format: You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val] . If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0 .",

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False , and both are accepted in the answer. A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes: • val : True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. • isLeaf : True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children. class Node { public boolean val; public boolean isLeaf; public Node topLeft; public Node topRight; public Node bottomLeft; public Node bottomRight; } We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: • If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's ) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop. • If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo. • Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid. If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki . Quad-Tree format: The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val] . If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0 .",
    "constraints": "• quadTree1 and quadTree2 are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a n * n grid. \n• n == 2 x where 0 <= x <= 9 .",

Specifically: • If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value. • If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child. • Omitting Empty Parentheses : Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., () ) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained. In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.",

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3 rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4 th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed. Example 2: Input: tasks = [\"A\",\"C\",\"A\",\"B\",\"D\",\"B\"], n = 1 Output: 6 Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\" , \"let\" , and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names. • Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do. In other words: • If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads. • If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread. We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists. For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way: Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n) . It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n) . See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list Implement the Skiplist class: • Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist. • bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise. • void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList. • bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true . If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false . If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine. Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.",

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks. Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e. , each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think. The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where: • philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat. • pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher. • eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks. • putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher. • The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number). Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.",

Successor(x, curOrder): if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder: if x is the king return null else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder) else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack. • In the beginning, curOrder will be [\"king\"] . • Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\"] . • Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\"] . • Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"] . • Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null . Thus the order of inheritance will be [\"king\", \"Alice\", \"Jack\", \"Bob\"] . Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Return the minimum number of letter changes required . A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​ • Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1 , it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed. • For a given divisor d , divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d . Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1 , 1 + d , 1 + 2d , and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2 , 2 + d , 2 + 2d , etc. • The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome. Consider the string \"abcabc\" : • The length of \"abcabc\" is 6 . Valid divisors are 1 , 2 , and 3 . • For d = 1 : The entire string \"abcabc\" forms one group. Not a palindrome. • For d = 2 : • Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5 ): \"acb\" • Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6 ): \"bac\" • Neither group forms a palindrome. • For d = 3 : • Group 1 (positions 1, 4 ): \"aa\" • Group 2 (positions 2, 5 ): \"bb\" • Group 3 (positions 3, 6 ): \"cc\" • All groups form palindromes.
