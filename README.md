## üîß Technical Details

### Files Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js          # Service worker for API calls and context menus
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js            # Content script for TakeUForward integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html            # Extension popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js              # Popup functionality and UI logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

### Permissions Used
- `activeTab`: Access current tab for title detection
- `storage`: Store temporary search data
- `contextMenus`: Add right-click search option
- `tabs`: Refresh pages when needed

### API Integration
- Uses LeetCode API (`leetcode-api-pied.vercel.app`) for problem data
- Handles rate limiting and error cases gracefully

### Matching Strategies
1. **Exact Match**: Direct title comparison (highest priority)
2. **Starts With**: Problem title starts with search term (4+ characters)
3. **Contains**: Search term contained in title (10+ characters, very strict)

### User-Friendly Interface
- Clean, modern dark theme design
- Responsive button interactions with hover effects
- Clear error messages and helpful guidance


### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Clear feedback when problems aren't found
- Automatic retry suggestions with refresh functionality
- Fallback detection methods for different page layouts
